                    <div class="bodytext" id="introtext"><p><span class="indent"></span>The small village of Bethalto is located in Madison County, Illinois, United States, approximately 30 miles (48km) northeast of St. Louis, Missouri. Founded in 1834, Bethalto has changed greatly over time from a small mining and railroad hub to the sleepy village it is today. With a population of nearly 10,000, it is peaceful and slow-moving. Keeping in theme, Bethalto's geography is also peaceful, being built atop soft, rolling hills and surrounded on all sides by cornrows and forests.</p> 
                
                     <p><span class="indent"></span>If one were to drive leisurely from one side of town to the other, they would be able to do so in 15 minutes or less. Along the way, they would be able to enjoy local specialties such as <a href="https://www.facebook.com/bethaltoromaspizza/" target="_blank">Roma's pizza </a>(founded in the 1970s by the locally beloved Pizzo family and maintained within the family to this day), <a href="https://www.genos140club.com/" target="_blank">Geno's 140 Club</a> (founded in 1942 and named after the local Illinois Route 140), or the newest joint in town - <a href="https://www.scooterscoffee.com/blog/post/scooters-coffee-opens-first-location-in-bethalto" target="_blank"> Scooter's Coffee</a>.</p>


                    <p><span class="indent"></span>Originally a railway town, Bethalto was formed around the movement and trade of coal. Throughout the 19th century, coal mining and agriculture were the main driving forces that made economic development in Bethalto possible. By the mid-20th century, the rail industry had moved its focus to nearby Edwardsville, and Bethalto transformed from a railway town into the suburban town it is today.
                    
                    <p><span class="indent"></span>As a reminder of its origins, former sections of Bethalto’s historical railways can be seen in...</p></div>

            <div class="bodytext" id="arbintro"><p><span class="indent"></span>Conceptualized in the early 1960s and built in 1966, Bethalto’s Arboretum is home to an extraordinary variety of fauna native and foreign to the area. Approximately 2.5 acres, a path stretches from one end to the other. Bethaltonians young and old enjoy the park as a means for exercise, relaxation, and for some, as a very popular Pokemon Go hotspot.</p>

                <p><span class="indent"></span>Throughout the park one will undoubtedly notice plagues and memorials scattered throughout, often placed underneath prominent trees. Residents  memorialize loved ones, living and passed, by dedicating these plaques to them. </p>
                
                <p><span class="indent"></span>Many residents of Bethalto have served in the US military and their service is remembered by a large war veteran memorial. This can be seen in the image below this paragraph.</p></div>

            <div class="bodytext" id="oldtownintro"><p><span class="indent"></span>The oldest part of Bethalto can be found on West Central street and the surrounding streets. The architecture of the buildings that can be found here dates back to the 19th and 20th centuries and is very characteristic of this time. Throughout the Midwest, there are many towns and cities with architecture reminiscent of Bethalto’s.</p>

            <p><span class="indent"></span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/kleinsbethalto/" target="_blank">Klein’s</a>, as seen below, has been a store that has existed in one form or another for over 150 years. Established in 1862, it has served generations of Bethaltonians.</div>

                <p><span class="indent"></span>Below is an image of Bethalto's Museum. Built in 1873, it is a two-story building modeled after Victorian and Italian architecture. It is the oldest government building still in use in Illinois' Madison County. Inside are many objects that are part of Bethalto's history, including a small, single jail cell that was actually used in the past and can still be visited today. Visitors are welcomed to view exhibits that present local citizens who served during World Wars 1 and 2, a recreated classroom modeled after early Bethalto schoolhouses, and depictions of early police, fire, and governmental departments. The Bethalto Museum is open to the public at no cost.</p>

                <p><span class="indent"></span>Next to the Bethalto Museum is Bethalto's Log Cabin. The Bethalto Log Cabin is perhaps the most iconic building in the village. Built in 1873, this small building once housed the town’s water, fire, and police departments. Each Christmas, the log cabin is opened to the public, allowing them to enter and view its authentically furnished interior.</p>
